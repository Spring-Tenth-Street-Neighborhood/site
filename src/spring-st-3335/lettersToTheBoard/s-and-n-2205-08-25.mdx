Hello, we are writing in as residents of Spring street with respect to the county's plans to
purchase the home at 3335 Spring street as a transition home for young adults.

We agree that youth transition programs provide critical pathways for young adults. However,
moving so quickly on this proposal without community involvement does not install
confidence in future outcomes. If this proposal moves forward, this program will be intimately
part of our home lives for years to come, yet no information or outreach has been made with
us or our neighbors about how this program would integrate into the community nor even
details of who would run this program and how.

We request that the county supervisors make public the options and tradeoffs for planned
programs in this location _prior_ to the purchase of this property. There should be an
opportunity for public information and feedback at a time and place accessible for those of us
who work throughout the week.

Thank you
