To the Members of the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors,

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed purchase of the property at 3335 Spring Street, Redwood City for a temporary housing facility. As a concerned resident and voter, I urge you to vote against this proposal at your upcoming meeting. This project, while well-intentioned, is not in the best interest of our community or the county due to significant financial, logistical, and safety concerns.

## Financial and Structural Concerns

Purchasing this property is not a financially sound decision for the county. The community has uncovered numerous historical issues, including many un-permitted and unsanctioned additions. Bringing these up to code would be extremely expensive. During an open house, I personally observed uneven and sinking flooring, raising serious questions about the structural integrity of the house. These issues, along with the potential for costly earthquake retrofitting, suggest this is a poor investment of taxpayer funds.

## Financial Impact on the County

Beyond the costs of retrofitting and repairs, the proposed purchase would result in a significant loss of annual revenue for the county and our community. We estimate a loss of $22,602.12 in annual property tax revenue. The county would also lose an estimated $80,000 per year in potential interest (assuming a modest 4% return) on the funds used for the purchase. Additionally, the county would be responsible for ongoing yearly costs for 24-hour supervisory services, further burdening the budget. This acquisition presents both a direct expense and a long-term financial drain, diverting funds that could be used for other critical community services.

## Incompatibility with Neighborhood Infrastructure

The existing neighborhood infrastructure is not suitable for this project. Our area already suffers from significant parking issues, with a three-block radius of overflow from a nearby apartment complex. An influx of residents and visitors would exacerbate this problem, leading to increased traffic, noise, and parking sprawl into surrounding blocks. Furthermore, the property's location lacks walkability and adequate public transportation, severely limiting residents' access to essential amenities like groceries, community services, and public spaces without a car.

## Impact on Property values

Placing a high-density temporary housing facility in a single-family residential neighborhood is a serious concern for local homeowners. Many residents have made significant financial investments in their homes, and similar projects in other communities have been shown to negatively impact property values. This project could undermine the long-term financial stability of the very residents the county is meant to serve.

## Concerns about Housing Density and Capacity

The plan to house up to 12 residents in a single-family zoned home raises serious concerns about housing density. While the initial proposal was to begin with no more than six residents for the first six months, messaging from the county indicated the home would eventually house up to 12 men and women. This is a significant increase in density for a single-family lot. Furthermore, similar programs operated by the Service League of San Mateo, housing 2 men or 3 women per room at once. In this house, that would be up to 18 women, or a co-ed mix of 12 to 15 men and women. Our neighborhood infrastructure, including traffic, sewage service, and parking, is simply not equipped to handle the needs of 12 to 18 additional residents.

## Legal and Zoning concerns

Our neighborhood can challenge the placement of this facility through local zoning laws and regulations. The U.S. Supreme Court has established legal precedent that supports the ability of a municipality to draw distinctions that limit the number of unrelated people who can constitute a family in a single-family zoned area. This was affirmed in the case of Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas, 416 U.S. 1 (1974), which confirms that legislative bodies have the authority to regulate housing density in residential communities.

## Proximity to Taft Elementary School

A primary concern is the property's proximity to Taft Elementary School. The house is located within 2,000 feet of the school, a distance that is legally off-limits to registered sex offenders. At the community meeting, we were provided with insufficient information regarding the background checks that would be performed on potential residents, which is a major concern for the safety of our children. It is also important to note that employees and parents of Taft Elementary have not been adequately informed or consulted on this plan.

## Insufficient Planning and Community Engagement

This project appears to have been hastily organized without proper due diligence. At the community meeting, critical details regarding management, oversight, and operational costs were notably absent. The presenters were unable to provide viable solutions to the communityâ€™s concerns, nor could they explain why this facility would succeed when a nearby youth center on Douglas Avenue, run by a different organization, failed and negatively impacted the surrounding neighborhood. The lack of information and minimal community outreach have created significant negative sentiment, which should not be ignored.

In conclusion, placing a temporary housing facility at 3335 Spring Street is a poor fit for this location. It would create unnecessary costs for the county, strain our already limited infrastructure, and raise significant safety concerns for local families. I implore you to consider these facts and vote NO on this proposal.

Sincerely,
A neighbor and voter near 3335 Spring St. Redwood City, CA.
