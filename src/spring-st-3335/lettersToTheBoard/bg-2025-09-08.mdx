I saw the information about this housing when it was on Douglas Ave. in Redwood
City and am concerned about the fact that police had been called out to this
residence more than once and reports of noise and excessive garbage at the site.
I live just around the corner and am not sure this kind of housing is the right thing to
put in a quiet residential area.

thanks ,
B.G.
