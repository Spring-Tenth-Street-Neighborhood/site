Hello San Mateo County Board of Supervisors,

As a follow-up to my email last week regarding the Countyâ€™s proposal to convert 3335
Spring St, Redwood City, CA into a halfway house, I am submitting the attached petition
signed by (as of Monday, September 8th at 7:56pm PT) **146 residents**.

These signatures reflect the strong and unified opposition of our neighborhood to the
conversion of a private home situated at 3335 Spring St, Redwood City, CA into a halfway
house. Residents are deeply concerned about the lack of transparency, the incompatibility of
this project with the zoning / residential character of our area, and the absence of meaningful
community input in the decision-making process.

On behalf of the signatories, we respectfully request the following immediate actions:

1. Pause all acquisition or approval steps related to this property until community
   concerns have been addressed.
2. Schedule follow up public community meetings with adequate notice so residents can
   directly engage with County staff and decision-makers. ( we were told we would get
   another community meeting, but that has yet to be scheduled)
3. Pause any purchase or approval until the community has been fully consulted.
4. Explore alternative sites that would be better suited for this type of project.
5. Vote NO on this project if a fully thought out decision can not be made at this moment
   in time.

We support effective rehabilitation and re-entry programs, but they must be implemented in
a transparent, lawful, and collaborative way that does not unfairly burden residential
neighborhoods.

Please confirm receipt of this petition. I look forward to chatting with you all at tomorrow's
Board of Supervisors meeting.

Thank you for your immediate attention.
