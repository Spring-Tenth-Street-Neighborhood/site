To whom this may concern,

I am writing with deep concern regarding San Mateo County’s plan to purchase and convert 3335
Spring St, Redwood City, CA into a halfway house.
Our community was given no advance notice or opportunity to provide input on this
decision. We strongly oppose this proposal for the following reasons:

1, Neighborhood Impact – This is a quiet residential area with children, schools, and
families. Converting a single-family home into a high-impact group facility would
fundamentally change the character of our neighborhood. Not only that, but it would
also be putting folks who may not have been properly vetted within 2000ft of Taft
Elementary school.

2. Lack of Transparency – Residents only recently became aware of this plan... and only
   homes within a 300ft radius got any sort of communication. A decision of this
   magnitude requires full disclosure, community meetings, and meaningful consultation.

3. Zoning & Land Use – This use is not consistent with the property’s current zoning.
   We ask for a formal review of zoning compliance and environmental impacts under
   CEQA before any approval.

4. Better Alternatives – If the County believes such a facility is needed, more appropriate
   sites exist in commercial or multifamily zones with access to transit and services.
   There are many buildings north of 5th ave that would be much more appropriate for
   this sort of project.

We urge you to:

- Pause any purchase or approval until the community has been fully consulted.
- Hold multiple public community meetings before making a decision.
- Explore alternative sites that would not harm residential neighborhoods and pose threats to Taft Elementary School.
- Vote NO on this project.

We support effective re-entry and rehabilitation programs, but this process must be
transparent, lawful, and respectful of our community.

Thank you for your immediate attention. Please confirm receipt of this letter and advise how
San Mateo County will ensure proper community engagement.
