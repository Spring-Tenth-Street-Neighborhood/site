Hello San Mateo County Board of Supervisors,

In regards to the proposed housing project at 3335 Spring St, our community is deeply troubled by the
lack of transparency in this process the incompatibility of the project with the character and zoning of the
area, and the absence of meaningful consultation with residents before moving forward.

I respectfully request the following:

1. That the County pause all acquisition or approval steps related to this property until the
   community’s concerns have been addressed.
2. That a follow-up public meeting be scheduled with sufficient notice, so residents may engage
   directly with County staff and decision-makers. We were told another meeting would be provided, but
   none has yet been scheduled.
3. That no purchase or approval move forward until proper consultation has taken place.
4. That the County explore other sites more suitable for this type of facility.
5. That, should a well-considered decision not be possible at this time, the Board vote NO on this
   project.

We strongly support responsible rehabilitation and re-entry programs.

However, such efforts must be undertaken with transparency, community involvement, and in a manner
that does not disproportionately burden residential neighborhoods.

I will be present at tomorrow’s Board of Supervisors meeting and look forward to speaking with you in
person.
Respectfully,

A.A.
