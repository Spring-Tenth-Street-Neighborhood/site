To the Members of the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors,

I am writing to express my **strong opposition to the proposed purchase of the property at 3335 Spring Street, Redwood City for a temporary housing facility**. As a concerned resident and voter, I urge you to vote against this proposal at your upcoming meeting. This project, while well-intentioned, is not in the best interest of our community or the county due to significant financial, logistical, and safety concerns.

You are shoving people into very small spaces: For 2 people to legally occupy a bedroom in unincorporated San Mateo County, the room must be at least 100 square feet in area, with at least one dimension no less than 7 feet, must meet ceiling height standards, and must have an egress-compliant window or exit.

**Do these bedrooms meet those requirements?**

This house was originally built as a 3 bedroom/2 bath, then sold as a 5 bedroom/4 bathroom in 2024. I don’t see any permit for the 3 additional bedrooms, only a permit to add a study room, but not a bedroom. **How can the county legally purchase a home without correct permits? (see attached)** <a href="https://spring-tenth-street-neighborhood.github.io/site/SPRING-ST-3335-REDWOOD-CITY.pdf" style={{color:'inherit'}}>attachment</a>

One of your reasons for this purchase is transit availability, but this property has a poor transit score of **3.2/10**. I found 4 other properties listed in San Mateo county for < 2 million, that have much higher transit scores:

- **7.7/10**: 157 Station Ave, Daly City, 7 bedroom/6 bathroom listed at $1,888,000
- **7.7/10**: 63 Werner Ave, Daly City, 5 bedroom/5 bathroom listed at $1,799,000
- **6/10**: 101 Del Prado Dr, Daly City, 7 bedroom/6 bathroom listed at $1,480,000
- **5.1/10**: 120 Gardiner Ave, South San Francisco, 7 bedroom/4 bathroom listed at $1,499,999

One significant concern is the **existing parking problem** in the neighborhood. An influx of residents and visitors, potentially bringing additional vehicles, would exacerbate parking sprawl into surrounding blocks. This area already experiences a three-block radius of parking overflow from a nearby apartment complex.

**Zoning & Land Use** – This use is not consistent with the property’s current zoning. We ask for a formal review of zoning compliance and environmental impacts under CEQA before any approval.

We agree that youth transition programs provide critical pathways for young adults. However, moving so quickly on this proposal without community involvement does not install confidence in future outcomes. If this proposal moves forward, this program will be intimately part of our home lives for years to come, yet no information or outreach has been made with us or our neighbors about how this program would integrate into the community nor even details of who would run this program and how.

We request that the county supervisors make public the options and tradeoffs for planned programs in this location prior to the purchase of this property. There should be an opportunity for public information and feedback at a time and place accessible for those of us who work throughout the week.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Resident and Voter near 3335 Spring Street
