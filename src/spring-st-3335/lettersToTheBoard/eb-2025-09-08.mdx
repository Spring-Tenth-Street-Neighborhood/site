Hi,

I am writing to reiterate my significant concerns regarding the proposed purchase of 3335 Spring St, Redwood City, by the county for a temporary housing facility. I understand that the vote on this approval was delayed to allow for a more thorough exploration of the issues and increased community engagement. Despite these efforts, I urge you to vote against this proposal.

County resources would be better utilized for temporary housing solutions near El Camino Real. This area offers established temporary housing options, as well as sufficient transportation and commercial facilities.

Purchasing this house is not financially sound for the county. The property has a large price tag and would need to house more people than it was designed for. The community has also uncovered numerous issues, including many unsanctioned and unpermitted additions, which would be extremely expensive to bring up to code.

Buying a house in an area with significant community opposition to the youth home could result in many complaints, potential lawsuits, and county code violations. The close examination of the house and its occupants by the community would probably lead to frequent reports, increasing the workload and expenses for the operators.

The proposal to house up to 12 individuals on this single-family zoned property would create an unsustainable increase in housing density, overburdening the existing neighborhood infrastructure.

The county has not adequately polled the community for sentiment. Many neighbors are unaware of the plans for their block and nearby properties. Increased community engagement would reveal genuine concerns that deserve respect, rather than pushing through rushed plans.

Please vote no next week and letâ€™s start to look at better multi unit properties for this type of temporary
housing.
