Thanks for bringing this to the attention of those of us who live near this place, but not close enough to have been notified.

I appreciate your sentiment, but if this type of facility is not good enough for this location , it should not be good enough for ANY location within North Fair Oaks.

Historically NFO has been the site of many projects that would have never been accepted in other communities. We, the NFO community, need to be united on this. Our community is less than 2 square miles. What affects one small pocket of our community, affects us all, even if we are not fully aware of it.

I would like to encourage everyone to please advocate for this type of facility to be located on El Camino Real in any city. The County has made major real estate purchases along El Camino Real in the past, so this idea is not far fetched.

Finally, I just saw the change.org petition you kindly created. Thank you!

At the bottom of the petition I donâ€™t see Lisa Gauthier, Supervisor for District 4, which includes North Fair Oaks. Would it be possible to add her to that section? Thank you very much!
