This isn’t just about one house—it’s about preserving our sense of community, the character of our streets, and the rich memories so many of us share.

That home has been the backdrop of countless block parties, birthday celebrations, and moments that bring us closer together.

Transforming it into something that doesn’t fit the spirit of our neighborhood would be a real loss for all of us.

Let’s stand together to keep our community special, inclusive, and full of meaning.
