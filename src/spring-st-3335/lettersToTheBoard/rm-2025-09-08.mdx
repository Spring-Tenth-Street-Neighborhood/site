To the Members of the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors:

I am writing as a concerned resident of North Fair Oaks to express my strong opposition to the proposed
purchase of 3335 Spring Street for an interim youth transitional housing facility.

## Key Concerns

1. **Insufficient Community Notification and Engagement**

Neighbors including myself are concerned that notification was inadequate, raising legitimate concerns about
the transparency and inclusivity of the process.

2. **Questions About Selection Criteria and Oversight**

Despite originating from a well-intentioned purpose—replacing services after the shutdown of StarVista—there
are unanswered questions regarding:

- The vetting process for residents aged 18–24, including how applicants will be selected and monitored.
- The absence of a named operator for the facility at this time, which leaves a critical gap in
  accountability and oversight.

3. **Impact on Zoning, Property Values, and Tax Revenue**

The property is located in a single-family residential zone, and converting it to a group housing facility raises
zoning concerns. Many residents worry about potential negative impacts on:

- **Property values**, with some expressing that values “will be going down”.
- **Tax revenue**, since the property would become government-owned and potentially tax-exempt,
  decreasing funds available for essential services.

4. **High Purchase Price and Potential Alternatives**

The proposed purchase price of **$2** million is considerable. Residents question whether more suitably located,
less expensive properties—ideally within mixed-use zones—could serve this purpose more effectively and with
fewer neighborhood impacts .

5. **Neighborhood Character and Capacity Concerns**

A single-family home with **6 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms** is expected to house up to 6 young adults initially,
with potential expansion to 12 residents . This raises legitimate concerns about:

- Whether the property’s layout and infrastructure can support such larger occupancy.
- The effect on neighborhood character, traffic, parking, and local infrastructure.

## Suggested Recommendations

I urge the Board to consider the following steps before moving forward:

1. **Hold additional community forums and extend the public comment period**, ensuring all neighbors, particularly those closest to the property, are adequately informed and heard.
2. **Provide full transparency on selection criteria and oversight**, including disclosure of potential operators and their track record.
3. **Reassess site selection**, exploring locations in mixed-use zones with better capacity, lower costs, and fewer residential impacts.
4. **Conduct an impact analysis**, particularly regarding traffic, parking, neighborhood character, and fiscal consequences.

## Conclusion

While addressing the urgent needs of youth aging out of foster care is both admirable and necessary,
community residents deserve a process that is transparent, equitable, and respectful of local concerns. At this
time, the proposed plan for 3335 Spring Street falls short on these fronts.

I respectfully urge the Board of Supervisors to pause the proposal and work collaboratively with the community
to find a solution that achieves the program’s goals without compromising neighborhood integrity.

Thank you for your thoughtful consideration.

Sincerely,
R.M.
