To the SMC Board of Supervisors -

Re: 9/9 Board of Supervisors mtg, **Agenda item #15** - Proposed purchase of 3335 Spring St., RWC dwelling for Transitional Adult Housing Project

I am writing to you to express my deep concerns regarding the County's intention of purchasing the above mentioned dwelling to set up an adult transitional home.

Our neighborhood is diverse, comprised of retired people like my wife and me who have owned our home for many years, as well as with new younger homeowners raising young children. Placing an adult transitional home that will potentially house up to 12 adults between the ages of 18-24, will impact our safety, property values along with a myriad of other issues by having it in our midst.

We strongly request the board of supervisors again **adjourn the approval to purchase this property / hold the set up of a transitional adult house and set up a community mtg** - which was approved at the 8/26 session - to allow the county officials and residents to further address our very valid concerns.

Please I deeply request you the board of supervisors hear your constituents' concerns.

Thank you,

E.H.
