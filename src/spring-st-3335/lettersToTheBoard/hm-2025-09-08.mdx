Good morning,
Item needs to be pulled from agenda. Per Board meeting on 8/26/25, Supervisor Lisa Gauthier was to schedule another community meeting regarding the property purchase of 3335 Spring Street. This has yet to be scheduled. We the neighbors have concerned about this purchase.

1. Why wasn’t the Douglas house purchased? It’s on sale for almost half the cost of the Spring Street house. Much closer to Middlefield
   for residents to easily access transportation; located in a semi-residential/industrial neighborhood
2. A Halfway House in a neighborhood near a school is a major safety concern. Who is vetting the residents?
3. What happens if the operator goes out of business?
