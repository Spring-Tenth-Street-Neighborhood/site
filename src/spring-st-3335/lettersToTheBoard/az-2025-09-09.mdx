To whom it may concern,
I am concerned with the county’s proposal to purchase 3335 Spring St Redwood City to be used as a
temporary housing facility. I beg you to **VOTE** NO against this proposal at the Board of Supervisors
meeting this Tuesday, August 26th for the following reasons:

1. **NO COMMUNICATION:** There has been little to no communication regarding this proposal
   where many of the neighbors are not aware of this proposal and what program the county will be
   using to home to support. Where is the communication from the county to the community?
2. **SINGLE -FAMILY ZONED:** This will create more congestion in an already very crowded area.
   We are already combating traffic and parking issues. From March Road to Spring it takes 20- 30
   minutes at times due to the traffic and given the already difficult housing situation in the Bay Area,
   cars parked on the street have become an increasing problem. Where is the urban planning
   report?
3. **OVERCROWDED AREA AND PARKING:** We already have a parking problem where the
   residents and visitors cannot park due to the overflow from the apartments and the school. Where
   are the studies that show traffic will not increase due to the housing facility? How will traffic be
   managed so it does not get worse?
4. **NO REGARD FOR SAFETY:** This house is located less than 2000 ft of Taft Elementary School,
   which is off limits to registered sex offenders. Based on the limited information provided at the
   community meeting regarding proper background checks for potential residents, this presents an
   additional concern for me, not only for the children but for myself and my neighbors who have
   made this area their home. How are you going to protect the safety of the children and residents?
   What are the safety measures?
5. **INCREASED CRIME:** Due to the lack of information I have received and the community has
   received, we do not have any data that adding a housing facility would not create additional crime.
   Where is the data? Where are the studies?
6. **DECREASED HOME VALUES:** People in this community moved here given its welcoming
   atmosphere, proximity to Redwood City and jobs, with many residents working multiple jobs in
   order to make ends meet (including myself). We have poured our savings into these homes and
   this community with the reasonable expectation that the zoning would not change and property
   values would increase over time. With this decision, the county is destroying the equity we have
   built over time and putting at risk our livelihoods, retirements and the most valuable asset any of
   us own. Is the county prepared to compensate residents of the area for the losses in home value
   that will occur as a result of this facility?

In addition, another youth center on Douglas Avenue failed, and in the last meeting the presenters did
not know why it failed and why this location would be different. We are aware how this youth facility
negatively impacted the neighborhood.

All in all, I have lived in this community for almost 30 years. I had to work two to three jobs to live in a safe
neighborhood and what the county is doing is pushing residents out of their homes knowing they cannot
afford to move somewhere else in the bay area. While the county’s proposal may be well intentioned, it
does not serve to benefit our neighborhood, our community, the safety of the children and of the
residents the county.

**Please VOTE NO** at Tuesday’s Board of Supervisor meeting.

A.Z.
