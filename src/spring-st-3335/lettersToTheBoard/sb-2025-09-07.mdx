To the Members of the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors,

I am a resident who lives near 3335 Spring Street and I am writing to strongly oppose the proposed plan to purchase this property for a temporary housing facility. While I support the goal of helping people in need, this particular location is not the right fit for this project due to significant financial, safety, and logistical issues.

## Financial and Structural concerns

From a financial standpoint, this is a poor use of taxpayer money. The house has numerous un-permitted additions and structural problems, including sinking floors, which I've personally observed. The cost to bring the property up to code, along with potential earthquake retrofitting, would be extremely high.

Beyond the purchase price and renovation costs, the county would also lose an estimated $22,602 in annual property tax revenue. The county would also be responsible for ongoing operational costs, including 24-hour supervision services, which will further drain public funds that could be used for other critical services.

## Neighborhood Impact and safety

The neighborhood infrastructure is not set up to handle this kind of project. We already have major parking and traffic problems, and adding more residents and visitors would make things much worse. The location also lacks easy access to public transportation, making it difficult for residents to get to places like grocery stores and other services without a car.

My biggest concern, as a woman living in this neighborhood, is the safety of our community, especially our children. The property is located less than 2,000 feet from Taft Elementary School, a distance legally off-limits to registered sex offenders. During the community meeting, we were not given enough information about the background checks for potential residents. This is a serious concern, and it feels as though the safety of our children has not been adequately considered.

I am also worried about the impact this project will have on local property values. Many of us have invested a lot of money into our homes, and placing a high-density facility in a single-family residential area could negatively affect our financial security.

## Lack of Planning and Community Engagement

This proposal feels rushed. There was a lack of clear information at the community meeting about how the facility would be managed, who would oversee it, and what the operational costs would be. The county's representatives couldn't provide viable solutions to the communityâ€™s concerns, which makes me question whether this project has been properly planned. The significant negative sentiment from the community should not be ignored.

In conclusion, I urge you to vote no on the proposal to purchase 3335 Spring Street. This project is not a good fit for our community and would create unnecessary financial and safety burdens. Please consider the facts and listen to the concerns of your constituents.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Resident and Voter near 3335 Spring Street
